Adding to the answer of @Grabofus , the action will fail if there's already an existing and open PR for the same head and base. This can be solved by checking for an existing PR prior to creating a new one:

  create_pull_request:
    name: 'Create PR'
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/beta'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - deploy
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: 'Create PR'
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const { repo, owner } = context.repo;
            const pulls = await github.rest.pulls.list({
              owner: owner,
              repo: repo,
              head: context.ref,
              base: 'dev',
              state: 'open',
            });
            
            if (pulls.data.length < 1) {
              await github.rest.pulls.create({
                title: '[Sitemap] Merge sitemap into dev',
                owner: owner,
                repo: repo,
                head: context.ref,
                base: 'dev',
                body: [
                  'This PR is auto-generated by',
                  '[actions/github-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script)',
                ].join('\n'),
              });
            } else {
              const existingPR = pulls.data[0];
              await github.rest.pulls.update({
                owner: owner,
                repo: repo,
                pull_number: existingPR.number,
                body: [
                  existingPR.body,
                  `Updated by Job ${context.job}`,
                ].join('\n'),
              });
            }
