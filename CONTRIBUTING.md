Hi, there! Welcome to XMOJ-Script!

We are happy to have you here with us!

We believe that you must be excited to contribute to our repo, but first, please read the contribution guidelines!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 请注意, 外部开发者应向`extern-contrib`提交 pull requests。

- Our goal for `xmoj-script` is **stability before features**. This means we focus on squashing critical bugs before adding new features. Often, we can do both in tandem, but bugs will take priority over a new feature.
- We use Bootstrap in our project. Please use Bootstrap classes instead of writing your own CSS whenever possible.
- Do not run a code formatter.
- Do not use any external libraries without prior permission
- For new features, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
- Respect the original code style. Variables should be camelCase, functions should be PascalCase, and classes should be TitleCase. There is a bunch of old code that doesn't follow this rule, but new code should.
- Commit Unix line endings.
- Before Submitting your Pull Request, merge `dev` with your new branch and fix any conflicts. (Make sure you don't break anything in development!)
- Be patient. We are a small team and may not be able to review your PR immediately.
- Please be considerate towards the developers and other users when raising issues or presenting pull requests.
- Respect our decision(s), and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used
